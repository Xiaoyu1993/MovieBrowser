Progress: I have finished layout of the movie overview page with CSS. In this overview page, the title, tagline, keywords and brief introduction of the movie is displayed. And there is a navigation bar with some links that will jump to the other two views in the future. And I choose to use a word cloud to visualize the keywords of the movie. This word cloud is written in D3.}
